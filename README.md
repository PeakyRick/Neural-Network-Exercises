# Neural-Network-Exercises
A repository with notebooks examples for Neural Network and Deep Learning concepts and techniques.

The notebooks are based on course material of CSC2516 from University of Toronto, which I completed in 2023. Link to the course website: <https://uoft-csc413.github.io/2023/>
