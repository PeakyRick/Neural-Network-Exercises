# Neural-Network-Exercises
A repository with notebooks examples for Neural Network and Deep Learning concepts and techniques.

This repository contains examples of notebooks demonstrating concepts and techniques related to neural networks and deep learning. These notebooks are based on the course material from CSC2516 at the University of Toronto, which I completed in 2023. You can find the link to the course website here: https://uoft-csc413.github.io/2023/.

In most cases, the notebooks in this repository include my own implementations of the concepts discussed in the course material. Although these notebooks may use helper functions from existing notebooks, these notebooks nevertheless serve to showcase my understanding of the concepts covered in the course and demonstrate my familiarity with the application pipelines.
